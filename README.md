# CKS-E

*What Is This?*

CKS-E is a tool that allows you to remap and redirect user input to one or more applications. Its primary use case is for triggering repetitive actions in games such as World of Warcraft but there are many possible uses.

*So How Is This Different From CKS?*

CKS-E has a number of changes:

* Listen To Joypad - Joypad input can be detected and remapped.
* Networking - CKS-E can be used to send detected input on one computer to trigger actions on another. Work on a laptop while your desktop does MMO crafting!
* Load/Save profiles - Configs can be simply saved and loaded to and from their own files.
* Key Up/Down Emulation - CKS-E allows you to configure an interval between key down and up events.
* Lower CPU Usage - CKS wasn't exactly a CPU hog but CKS-E uses far less CPU when listening to analogue inputs.
* Various minor bugs fixed.

Note that CKS-E has also removed some features:

* Multiple key strokes per input - removed for better WoW TOS compliance. Open for discussion if people provide use cases showing a need.
* Auto Refresh Program List - removed because I couldn't find anyone who used it and I needed the UI space.

*What Does The 'E' Stand For?*

Nothing. I mean you could think of it as Extended or Evolved or Expanded or Extant but it's just a way to flag that this isn't CKS. The CKS doesn't stand for Consortium Key Sender either as I've never even been a member of those forums.

*You've Stolen The Code And Claimed It As Your Own!*

I'm not hiding the origin of the application. I've included an attribution and a link to the original. As stands I've rewritten pretty much every part of the code and most of what was there is stuff that is freely available on AutoHotkey forums as example code anyway. The original hasn't been updated or actively supported in many years and was posted without a licence. It's not my intention to steal anything here. I just wanted some more features and to have a proper repository and central location for a tool that is fairly important to the WoW goldmaking community.
